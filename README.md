# ⚠️ This library is no longer under active development ⚠️
Swimlane no longer uses this library in our codebase. That may change in the future, but for now it will no longer be maintained.

coconspirators is a microservice framework for RabbitMQ written in TypeScript. Under the hood it uses
[amqp.node](https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node), the battle-tested AMQP client, to communicate
with RabbitMQ and has best-practices baked in. Features include:

- Simple API for subscribing, publish and replying
- DI Friendly
- TypeScript First

## Install

`npm i coconspirators --S`

## Building

`npm run build`

## Usage

```typescript
import { Queue, AmqpQueue, AmqpClient  } from 'coconspirators';

export class AmqpServer {
  connection: Promise<any>;
  constructor(public client: AmqpClient, logger: Logger) {
    this.connection = this.client.connect();

    client.on('connected', () => console.log('connected!'));
    client.on('disconnected', () => console.log('disconnected!'));
  }
}

interface ZooMessage {
  animal: string;
}

@Queue({
  name: 'health'
  contentType: 'application/json'
})
export class HealthQueue extends AmqpQueue<ZooMessage> {
  constructor(client: AmqpClient) { super(client); }
}

export class HealthChecker {
  constructor(queue: HealthQueue) {
    this.queue.publish({ hi: true });
    this.queue.subscribe((message: ZooMessage) => {
      console.log('message', message);
    })
  }
}
```
